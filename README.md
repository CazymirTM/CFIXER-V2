This app does what it says, it uses GUI because C# shi, you can select what fixes to apply, or apply all of them (select multiple), it only have 3 fixes cause if you have big viruses problems then you're cooked, i put mostly usefull stuff in it.



(It doesn't use any extension, it simply uses windows cmd to apply some fixes but with GUI).
